# Simulation of a modified War card game

## Directions for running the simulation:
1. Ensure that java is installed on your computer
2. Navigate to the directory containing the source code
4. Compile the .java files: `javac *.java`
3. Put as an integer the number of games to play as a command line argument after `java Main`. Example: `java Main 5`

## Notes
- I wrote all of the .java files myself except WarLogger.java which was provided for grading purposes. I had to write in some lines of code in the other classes for the WarLogger to work. These extra lines of code can be removed and the program will still function the same. If you would like to see an underlying game of war taking place, the WarLogger.war file is created/overwritten for each game played.

- To write the classes I used the outline we were given. This outline is in the specification pdf.
