# Cannon Skeet Blast Video Game

- This project is an exercise in creating my own video game from scratch. I utilized Unity and wrote C# scripts to make the game. The premise of the game is that the player controls a cannon in a castle tower and is tasked with shooting skeet targets until they run out of cannon balls.

## Directions for testing the game:
1. The provided build only works on Windows computers.
2. Enter the `Cannon Skeet Blast Windows Build` folder in Windows Explorer
3. Open `Cannon Skeet Blast.exe` and enjoy.

## Notes
This project was completed in Unity 2019.4.9f1. If you are interested in the Unity Project Folder (perhaps to make a build for a different operating system), I can provide that as well if you let me know by emailing me at hakeman@chapman.edu. I ommitted the project folder in interest of keeping my portfolio smaller in terms of megabytes.

I did include the C# source code which I wrote that runs the game. It is in the C# Source Code folder.
